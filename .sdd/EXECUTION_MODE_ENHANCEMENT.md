# Execution Mode Enhancement

**Feature:** User Choice Between One-by-One and Immediate Execution  
**Date:** 2025-10-21  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Overview

Enhanced `/sdd-full-plan` and `/pecut-all-in-one` commands to ask users how they want to proceed with task creation - either step-by-step (one-by-one) for learning, or all-at-once (immediate) for fast setup.

## The Enhancement

### Before
Commands would generate all tasks immediately after roadmap plan approval.

### After
Commands now ask users to choose their preferred execution mode:
- **Option A: One-by-One Processing** - Interactive, step-by-step learning
- **Option B: Immediate Execution** - Fast, all-at-once creation

## Why This Matters

### For Learners
- **One-by-One mode** helps users understand their project structure
- Review each epic/task before it's created
- Learn about dependencies and relationships
- Adjust approach as understanding grows

### For Experienced Users
- **Immediate mode** provides fast setup
- Complete roadmap ready in seconds
- All tasks visible from start
- Ready for team collaboration immediately

## Implementation Details

### User Prompt

After roadmap plan approval, AI asks:

```
How would you like to proceed with task creation?

Option A: One-by-One Processing (Recommended for learning)
- Review and approve each task as it's created
- Understand each phase before moving forward
- Interactive, step-by-step learning about your project
- Best for: New projects, learning, thorough review

Option B: Immediate Execution
- Generate all tasks at once after roadmap approval
- Fast, automated task creation
- Quick setup for experienced users
- Best for: Well-understood projects, experienced teams

Which mode would you prefer? (A/B or 'one-by-one'/'immediate')
```

### One-by-One Mode Workflow

1. Create roadmap skeleton (basic structure)
2. Present first epic/task for approval
3. Wait for user confirmation
4. Create task if approved
5. Show progress summary
6. Present next task
7. Repeat until complete
8. Allow mode switching mid-process

**Example Flow:**
```
Epic 1: Research & Foundation
- Task 1-1: Research patterns (8h)
- Task 1-2: Define architecture (16h)
Create this epic? (Yes/No/Skip)

→ User: Yes

✅ Epic 1 created!
Progress: 1/5 epics (20%)
Ready for Epic 2?
```

### Immediate Mode Workflow

1. Generate complete roadmap.json with ALL tasks
2. Create all task JSON files
3. Generate complete roadmap.md
4. Set up execution-log.md
5. Update registry
6. Provide comprehensive summary

**Example Output:**
```
✅ Roadmap created!

Total epics: 5
Total tasks: 20
All tasks ready for execution!
Start with: /execute-task epic-001
```

### Mode Switching

Users can switch modes mid-process:

```
You've created 3 of 8 epics so far.
Would you like to:
- Continue one-by-one (recommended)
- Switch to immediate mode (create remaining 5 epics now)
- Pause and review what we have so far
```

# User: "Option A - One-by-One"
# AI creates tasks one epic at a time
```

### Immediate Mode
```bash
/pecut-all-in-one notifications Add email notifications

# AI presents plan → User approves
# AI asks: "One-by-One or Immediate?"
# User: "Option B - Immediate"
# AI creates all tasks at once
```
