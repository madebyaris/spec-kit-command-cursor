## 🎯 What is Spec-Driven Development?

> **Stop coding blindly. Start building with purpose.**

Spec-Driven Development is a revolutionary methodology that emphasizes creating detailed, executable specifications **before** writing a single line of code. This approach ensures that:

- 🎯 **Requirements are crystal clear** before implementation begins
- 🏗️ **Technical decisions are well-planned** and documented
- 📋 **Development tasks are structured** and manageable
- 🤝 **Team collaboration** is enhanced through shared understanding
- 🚀 **Delivery is faster** with fewer iterations and scope changes

### 🎨 PLAN Mode Integration (New!)

All SDD commands now integrate with **Cursor's PLAN mode** for enhanced control and visibility:

```
Every Command: User Request → Analysis → Present Plan → Approve → Execute
```

**What This Means:**
- 👁️ **See before create** - Review what will be generated before any files are made
- ✅ **Approve or modify** - Change the approach before execution
- 🧠 **Learn the reasoning** - Understand AI's thinking and decisions
- 🛡️ **Safety first** - No surprise file changes or modifications
- 🎯 **Better quality** - More thoughtful, deliberate specifications

**Example Flow:**
1. You run `/brief checkout-flow Quick checkout for guest users`
2. AI analyzes requirements and existing patterns
3. AI presents a plan showing brief structure, research approach, and what will be created
4. You review and approve (or request changes)
5. AI executes, creating the feature brief as planned
6. Result: `specs/active/checkout-flow/feature-brief.md` created with full visibility

## ✨ Key Features

</div>

---

## 🎨 PLAN Mode: Enhanced Workflow

All SDD commands now use **Cursor's PLAN mode** - a deliberate, plan-approve-execute pattern that gives you full control.

### How It Works

Every command follows a 4-phase workflow:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[1. Analysis] --> B[2. Create Plan]
    B --> C[3. User Approves]
    C --> D[4. Execute]
    D --> E[5. Document]
```

**Phase 1: Analysis (Readonly)**
- AI reads relevant files and context
- Asks clarifying questions if needed
- No file modifications yet

**Phase 2: Present Plan**
- Shows what will be created/modified
- Explains reasoning and approach
- Previews structure and content
- Waits for your approval

**Phase 3: Execute**
- Creates or modifies files as planned
- Follows approved approach exactly
- Maintains quality standards

**Phase 4: Document**
- Updates tracking files
- Records decisions made
- Sets up for next phase

### Example: `/brief` with PLAN Mode

**Traditional approach (old):**
```bash
/brief checkout-flow Quick checkout for guests
→ Boom! feature-brief.md created immediately
→ Hope it's what you wanted...
```

**With PLAN Mode (new):**
```bash
/brief checkout-flow Quick checkout for guests

AI: "Let me analyze this..."
→ Checks existing patterns
→ Identifies missing info
→ Asks: "Should guests be able to save cart for later?"

AI: "Here's my plan:"
→ Will create: specs/active/checkout-flow/feature-brief.md
→ Structure: Problem, Users, Requirements, Approach, Next Actions
→ Research: Will examine existing checkout patterns (15 min)
→ Key requirements: Guest checkout, cart persistence, session handling

You: "Looks good, but also add abandoned cart recovery"

AI: "Updated plan, creating now..."
→ Creates feature-brief.md with your additions
→ Full visibility, full control
```

### Benefits by User Type

**For Solo Developers:**
- 🔍 Catch issues before implementation
- 📚 Learn from AI's reasoning process
- 🎯 Ensure requirements are understood correctly
- ⚡ Modify approach before wasting time

**For Teams:**
- 👥 Review plans collaboratively before approval

### PLAN Mode Across All Commands

| Command | What Plan Shows | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| `/brief` | Brief structure, research scope, requirements outline | Ensures 30-min planning is focused on right things |
| `/evolve` | Before/after changes, changelog entry, impact | Prevents accidental overwrites of important context |
| `/research` | Search strategy, areas to examine, time allocation | Focuses research on most valuable patterns |
| `/specify` | Spec structure, requirements preview, user stories | Catches missing requirements early |
| `/plan` | Architecture approach, tech decisions, design rationale | Validates technical direction before deep planning |
| `/tasks` | Task breakdown strategy, effort estimates, dependencies | Ensures comprehensive coverage of all work |
| `/implement` | Todo-list preview, execution order, file changes | Shows implementation roadmap before coding |
| `/upgrade` | Brief expansion strategy, new documents, content mapping | Prevents information loss during escalation |

### Customizing Plans

You can modify any plan before approval:

```bash
AI: "Plan: I'll create 5 user stories focusing on happy path..."

You: "Add error scenarios and edge cases too"

AI: "Updated plan with error handling user stories..."
→ Proceeds with enhanced plan
```

### Tips for Using PLAN Mode

1. **Review plans thoroughly** - This is your chance to course-correct
2. **Ask questions** - If plan is unclear, ask for clarification
3. **Request changes** - Don't approve if something seems off
4. **Learn from plans** - Understand AI reasoning for better collaboration
5. **Use iteratively** - Plans get better as AI learns your preferences

### 📋 **For Tasks (`/tasks`)**

**⚡ Execute with Precision**
- Keep tasks small (1-2 days max)
- Define clear dependencies between tasks
- Include testing tasks for each feature  
- Estimate effort realistically

**✨ Pro Tip:** *Small tasks = big wins and faster feedback loops*

### 🎯 **The SDD Golden Rules**

| Rule | Why It Matters | Impact |
|------|----------------|---------|
| 📝 **Spec before code** | Prevents scope creep | 🚀 20% faster delivery |
| 🏗️ **Plan before build** | Reduces technical debt | 🔧 50% fewer refactors |
| ✅ **Tasks before work** | Improves team coordination | 🤝 Better collaboration |

</div>

## 🤝 Team Collaboration

### Multi-Developer Workflow
1. **Assign ownership** of specs, plans, and tasks
2. **Use progress.md** for status updates
3. **Review and iterate** on specifications
4. **Track dependencies** between features

### Status Tracking
Update feature status in `progress.md`:
```markdown
## Current Status: In Progress
- [x] Database schema design
- [x] API endpoints
- [ ] Frontend components (50% complete)
- [ ] Testing suite
```

### Code Reviews
Use `reviews.md` to track review feedback:
```markdown
## Review Comments
- Security: Add input validation (Fixed ✅)
- Performance: Optimize database queries (In Progress)
- UI: Improve mobile responsiveness (Pending)
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Feature not found" error:**
- Check feature name spelling
- Ensure feature exists in `specs/active/`

**"Missing dependencies" error:**
- Run commands in order: `/specify` → `/plan` → `/tasks`
- Check that required files exist

**Template processing errors:**
- Verify template files exist in `.sdd/templates/`
- Check template syntax for variables

### Getting Help

1. **Check guidelines**: Read `.sdd/guidelines.md`
2. **Review examples**: Look at existing features in `specs/active/`
3. **Validate structure**: Ensure directory structure matches expected format

## 📚 Advanced Usage

### Custom Commands
Extend the system by adding new command files to `.cursor/commands/`:

```markdown
