# SDD (Spec-Driven Development) System Overview

This project implements a comprehensive **Spec-Driven Development** workflow using three core commands that work together to transform ideas into structured implementation plans.

## Core Philosophy
Spec-Driven Development emphasizes creating detailed, executable specifications **before** writing code, ensuring:
- Requirements are clear before implementation
- Technical decisions are well-planned and documented  
- Development tasks are structured and manageable
- Team collaboration is enhanced through shared understanding

### PLAN Mode Integration
All SDD commands now follow a **plan-approve-execute** workflow inspired by Cursor's PLAN mode:

**Workflow Pattern:**
```
User Command → Analysis → Create Plan → User Approval → Execute → Document
```

**Key Principles:**
- **Analysis First** - Read, understand, ask questions before planning
- **Present Plans** - Show what will be created/modified before doing it
- **User Control** - Wait for approval before any file changes
- **Transparency** - Explain reasoning and approach in plans
- **Thoughtful Execution** - Deliberate, well-considered actions

**Benefits:**
- **Visibility** - See what will happen before it happens
- **Control** - Approve or modify plans before execution
- **Quality** - More thoughtful specifications and plans
- **Safety** - No surprise changes or modifications
- **Learning** - Understand AI reasoning and approach

## SDD 2.5: Agile-Compatible Lightweight Workflow (Default)

### Primary Approach (80% of features)

#### `/brief` - 30-Minute Planning
Transform ideas into actionable development plans in 30 minutes
- **Time**: 30 minutes total planning before coding
- **Output**: Single [feature-brief.md](mdc:specs/active/[task-id]/feature-brief.md) with essential context
- **Philosophy**: "Just enough" planning to start coding confidently
- **Key Elements**: Problem/users, quick research, requirements, next actions

#### `/evolve` - Living Documentation
Keep specifications aligned with reality during development
- **Purpose**: Continuous updates as discoveries are made during coding
- **Output**: Updates existing feature-brief.md with changelog
- **Philosophy**: Specifications as living documents that evolve with code

### Advanced Approach (20% of complex features) - SDD 2.0

For complex, high-risk, or multi-team features requiring comprehensive planning:

#### Full Workflow: `/research` → `/specify` → `/plan` → `/tasks` → `/implement`
- **Use When**: Feature complexity high, multiple stakeholders, significant architectural impact
- **Time Investment**: 4-6 hours upfront planning
- **Output**: Complete documentation suite (research.md, spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md)

## Decision Framework

**Start with `/brief`** unless feature meets ANY of these criteria:
- Multiple teams involved
- Architectural changes required
- High business risk/compliance needs
- Uncertain technical approach
- 3+ week development timeline

**Upgrade from brief to full SDD** if complexity discovered during implementation

## File Organization

The system uses a context-engineering approach with:
- **Active tasks**: [specs/active/[task-id]/](mdc:specs/active/) - Tasks currently in development
- **Task artifacts**: research.md, spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, todo-list.md, progress.md
- **Templates**: [.sdd/templates/](mdc:.sdd/templates/) - Reusable document templates  
- **Configuration**: [.sdd/config.json](mdc:.sdd/config.json) - System settings and preferences
- **Guidelines**: [.sdd/guidelines.md](mdc:.sdd/guidelines.md) - Development methodology guide

## Task ID Convention
- Use semantic slugs: `user-auth-system`, `payment-integration`, `dashboard-redesign`
- Avoid generic numbering: `feat-001` (legacy approach)
- Focus on meaningful, searchable identifiers

## Quality Assurance
Each phase includes comprehensive review checklists and validation rules to ensure:
- Specifications are clear and testable
- Plans are technically sound and scalable
- Tasks are actionable and properly estimated
- Documentation maintains consistency across the project

## Implementation & Todo-List Execution

**CRITICAL FOR AI ASSISTANTS:**  
Todo-lists are NOT suggestions - they are executable checklists that MUST be followed systematically.

### Todo Execution Rules
1. **Read entire list** before starting
2. **Execute in order** - respect dependencies
3. **Mark completion**: `- [ ]` → `- [x]`
4. **Document blockers** - never skip silently
5. **Update progress** continuously

### For AI Models (Cursor, ChatGPT, Claude)
- Todo-list is your implementation roadmap
- Each unchecked item is a required task
- Check off items as you complete them
- Document any deviations with rationale
- Ask before skipping or changing approach

## Collaboration Support
The system supports multi-developer workflows with:
- Assignee tracking for features and tasks
- Progress monitoring through status updates
- Review workflows with feedback integration
- Audit trails for change management
